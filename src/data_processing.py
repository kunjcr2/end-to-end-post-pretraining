"""
Data processing utilities for training datasets.

This file exists to handle all data loading, preprocessing, and formatting
for both SFT and GRPO training stages. It converts raw datasets from
HuggingFace into the format expected by the training scripts.

You will implement:
- process_ultrachat_to_sft: Convert UltraChat to single-turn SFT format
- process_pku_to_grpo: Convert PKU-SafeRLHF to GRPO format
- Tokenization and dataset creation utilities
- Train/validation splitting
